Welcome to the Login Portal Simulation documentation! This guide will explain the purpose and functionality of the main.py script,
designed to simulate a login portal with various features such as user registration, login, a to-do list, notepad, AI assistant, and more.

Overview
The main.py script was cretaed by Issa Joudeh for my Python project and it simulates a multi-functional portal that includes:

    User Registration & Login
    To-Do List Management
    A Notepad for notes
    An AI Assistant using the OpenAI API
    A simple Game
    Utility Tools (Internet Speed Test, Steganography, Password Hashing & Salting)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Structure
The script is structured into several key sections:

    User Authentication: Functions for registering, logging in, and logging out users.
    Navigation: Functions to navigate between different features.
    Features: Multiple features like To-Do List, Notepad, AI Assistant, Games, and Tools.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Main Functions
These functions handle the main operations of the script.

    def login_portal_sim():
        # Main function to start the login portal simulation
        users = { ... }  # User database
        ...
        return nav_logportal()  # Navigate to the login portal
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Navigation Functions
These functions handle navigation between different sections of the portal. You can use CTRL+Z on (Windows) or CTRL+D on (UNIX) to cancel an action at any point.

    def nav_logportal():
        # Function to navigate the login portal options
        ...
    def nav_general():
        # Function to navigate general user options
        ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


User Authentication
User Registration and Login

    These functions handle user registration, login, and logout processes.

        def register():
            # Function to register a new user
            ...
        def login():
            # Function to log in an existing user
            ...
        def logout(username):
            # Function to log out a user
            ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Users
There are 2 pre-registered users, they are:

    Games
    Simple Games

        These functions provide simple games for the user.

            def user_games():
                # Function to manage games
                ...
            def bulls_and_cows():
                # Function to play Bulls and Cows game
                ...

        It can be accssed with these (Pag-assistant will not give you these information):
            Username: Games
            Password: Lets_play99

Tools
Utility Tools

    These functions provide various utility tools for the user.

        def user_tools():
            # Function to manage utility tools
            ...
        Internet Speed Test
        def internet_speed_test():
            # Function to test internet speed
            ...
        Steganography Tools
        def steganography_tools():
            # Function to manage steganography tools
            ...
        Password Hashing & Salting
        def password_hashing_salting():
            # Function to hash and salt passwords
            ...

    This user can be accssed with these (Pag-assistant will not give you these information):
        Username: Tools
        Password: Im-usefu1 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Registering
    When registering a new user the user comes with three defult apps and they are:

    To-Do List
    To-Do List Management

        These functions allow users to create, edit, delete, list, and mark tasks as completed.

            def todo_list():
                # Function to manage the To-Do List
                ...

    Notepad
    Notepad Management

        These functions allow users to create, edit, delete, list, and read notes.

            def notepad():
                # Function to manage the Notepad
                ...

    AI Assistant
    AI Assistant using OpenAI API

        These functions handle interactions with an AI assistant named Pag, you can ask pag about different parts of the project.

            def ai_assistant():
                # Function to manage AI Assistant
                ...
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
    This is a documentation of my college project, it provides a comprehensive overview of the main.py script, detailing its structure and functionality.
    This project is about implementing security best practices into a login portal simulation in the terminal, like password requirments, password hashing and salting, error handeling, and providing security tools like stegnagrophy tools and a password hashing & salting tool.
    This project is intended for Proffesor Michael Mckeever, for the CS81.41A class, at the Santa Rosa Junior College.
    Feel free to explore the various features and customize the script as needed.

Thank you for your time, Happy coding!
